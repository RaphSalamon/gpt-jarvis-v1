# GPT-Jarvis: Phase One
# GPT-Jarvis: Phase One

A mini GPT-2 language model that is built and trained on raw script lines to replicate/simulate MARVEL'S J.A.R.V.I.S and Ultron.

**PROJECT OVERVIEW:** Currently in **PHASE ONE** of a multi stage personal AI project. The goal is to build an Transformer based chatbot that is identical to the Tone and speech of Fictional AI character-J.A.R.V.I.S

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python 3.12  
- PyTorch  
- Custom Transformer blocks  
- Git + GitHub  

---

## ✅ Phase One Goals
- ✅ Implement GPT-2 architecture from scratch using PyTorch  
- ✅ Create a basic dataset (raw script/text)  
- ✅ Train on the dataset and generate character-style outputs  
- ✅ Set up a functional training pipeline  
- ✅ Upload and track code via GitHub

## 📁 Files
- `train_gpt2.py` – Training loop and model pipeline  
- `idk.py` – Placeholder testing  
- `input.txt` – Raw text training data  
- `README.md` – This file  
- `.gitignore` – Ignores logs, model weights, etc.  

---

## 🚀 Phase Two Roadmap
- Collect more refined and high-quality dialogue (e.g. J.A.R.V.I.S. / Ultron lines)  
- Improve model generation (e.g. top-k sampling, temperature tuning)  
- Implement live chatbot interface  
- Fine-tune on curated Marvel-style conversations

## 📚 Resources

This project is a personal implementation of a mini transformer-based language model. It draws inspiration from educational material provided by Karpathy and builds on the core ideas introduced in the original Transformer architecture.
