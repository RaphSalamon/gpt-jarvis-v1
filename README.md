# GPT-Jarvis: Phase One
A mini GPT-2 language model that is built and trained on raw script lines to replicate/simulate MARVEL'S J.A.R.V.I.S and Ultron.

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
Currently in **PHASE ONE** of a multi stage personal AI project. The goal is to build an Transformer based chatbot that is identical to the Tone and 
speech of Fictional AI character-J.A.R.V.I.S
## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Python 3.12
- PyTorch
- Custom Transformer blocks
- Git + GitHub

---
## ✅ Phase One Goals

- [x] Implement GPT-2 architecture from scratch using PyTorch  
- [x] Create a basic dataset (raw script/text)  
- [x] Train on the dataset and generate character-style outputs  
- [x] Set up a functional training pipeline  
- [x] Upload and track code via GitHub  

## 📁 Files

- `train_gpt2.py` – Training loop and model pipeline  
- `idk.py` – Placeholder testing  
- `input.txt` – Raw text training data  
- `README.md` – This file  
- `.gitignore` – Ignores logs, model weights, etc.

## 🚀 Phase Two Roadmap

- Collect more refined and high-quality dialogue (e.g. J.A.R.V.I.S. / Ultron lines)
- Improve model generation (e.g. top-k sampling, temperature tuning)
- Implement live chatbot interface
- Fine-tune on curated Marvel-style conversations
