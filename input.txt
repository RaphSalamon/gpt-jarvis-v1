"J.A.R.V.I.S., are you up?"
"For you sir, always."
"I'd like to open a new project file, index as: Mark II."
"Shall I store this on the Stark Industries' central database?"
"I don't know who to trust right now. 'Til further notice, why don't we just keep everything on my private server."
"Working on a secret project, are we, sir?"
"I don't want this winding up in the wrong hands. Maybe in mine, it could actually do some good."
―Tony Stark and J.A.R.V.I.S.[src]
"J.A.R.V.I.S., you there?"
"At your service, sir."
"Engage heads up display."
"Check."
"Import all preferences from home interface."
"Will do, sir."
"Alright, what do you say?"
"I have indeed been uploaded, sir. We're online and ready."
"Can we start the virtual walk-around?"
"Importing preferences and calibrating virtual environment."
"Do a check on the control surfaces."
"As you wish."
―Tony Stark and J.A.R.V.I.S.[src]
"Test complete. Preparing to power down and begin diagnostics."
"Uh, yeah, tell you what. Do a weather and ATC check, start listening in on ground control."
"Sir, there are still terabytes of calculations required before an actual flight is—"
"J.A.R.V.I.S., sometimes you gotta run before you can walk. Ready in three... two... one."
―J.A.R.V.I.S. and Tony Stark[src]
"Alright, let's see what this thing can do. What's SR-71's record."
"The altitude record for fixed wing flight is eighty-five thousand feet, sir."
"Records are made to be broken. Come on!"
―Tony Stark and J.A.R.V.I.S.[src]
"Sir, there is a potentially fatal buildup of ice occurring."
"Keep going! Higher!"
―J.A.R.V.I.S. and Tony Stark[src]
"Notes: main transducer feels sluggish at plus 40 altitude. Hull pressurization is problematic. I'm thinking icing is the probable factor."
"A very astute observation, sir. Perhaps if you intend to visit other planets, you should include the we should improve the exosystems."
"Connect to the sys. co. Have it reconfigure the shell metals. Use the gold titanium alloy from the seraphim tactical satellite. That should ensure a fuselage integrity while while maintaining power-to-weight ratio. Got it?"
"Yes. Shall I render using proposed specifications?"
"Thrill me."
―Tony Stark and J.A.R.V.I.S.[src]
"The render is complete."
"A little ostentatious, don't you think?"
"What was I thinking? You're usually so discrete."
"Tell you what, throw a little hot rod red in there."
"Yes, that shall help you keep a low profile."
―J.A.R.V.I.S. and Tony Stark[src]
"Sir, the more you struggle, the more this is going to hurt."
"Be gentle. This is my first time. I designed this to come off so—. Ow! Hey, I really should be able to..."
"Please, try not to move, sir."
―J.A.R.V.I.S. and Tony Stark[src]
"How do you think the Mark I chest piece is gonna hold up?"
"The suit's at 48% power and falling, sir. That chest piece was never designed for sustained flight."
"Keep me posted."
―Tony Stark and J.A.R.V.I.S.[src]
"Impressive! You've upgraded your armor! I've made some upgrades of my own!"
"Sir, it appears that his suit can fly."
"Duly noted. Take me to maximum altitude."
"With only 15% power, the odds of reaching that al—."
"I know the math! Do it!"
―Iron Monger, J.A.R.V.I.S. and Iron Man[src]
"13% power, sir."
"Climb!"
"11%."
"Keep going."
"7% power."
"Just leave it on the screen. Stop telling me."

"Query complete, sir. Anton Vanko was a Soviet physicist who defected to the United States in 1963. However, he was accused of espionage and was deported in 1967. His son, Ivan, who is also a physicist, was convicted of selling Soviet-era weapons-grade plutonium to Pakistan, and served fifteen years in Kopeisk prison. No further records exist."

"How many ounces a day of this gobbledygook am I supposed to drink?"
"We are up to 80 ounces a day to counteract the symptoms, sir."
"Check Palladium levels."
"Blood toxicity, 24%. It appears that the continued use of the Iron Man suit is accelerating your condition. Another core has been depleted."
"God, they're running out quick."
"I have run simulations on every known element, and none can serve as a viable replacement for the palladium core. You are running out of both time and options. Unfortunately, the device that's keeping you alive is also killing you."
―Tony Stark and J.A.R.V.I.S.[src]

―J.A.R.V.I.S. to Iron Man[src]
Spoken about J.A.R.V.I.S.
"So why didn't S.H.I.E.L.D. bring him in on the Tesseract project? I mean, What are they doing in the energy business in the first place?"
"I should probably look into that once my decryption program finishes breaking into all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s secure files."
"I'm sorry, did you say-?"
"J.A.R.V.I.S. has been running it since I hit the bridge. In a few hours we'll know every dirty secret S.H.I.E.L.D. has ever tried to hide."
―Bruce Banner, Tony Stark and Steve Rogers[src]
"What is Phase 2?"
"Phase 2 is S.H.I.E.L.D. uses the cube to make weapons. Sorry, the computer was moving a little slow for me."

"Sir, Agent Coulson of S.H.I.E.L.D. is on the line."
"I'm not in. I'm actually out."
"Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting."
"Grow a spine, J.A.R.V.I.S.. I got a date."
―J.A.R.V.I.S. and Tony Stark[src]

"Sir, please may I request just a few hours to calibrate-"
"Nope! Micro-repeater implanting sequence complete!"
"As you wish, sir. I've also prepared a safety briefing for you to entirely ignore."
"Which I will."

"Check the heart, check the, check the, is it the brain?"

"Creating a flight plan for Tennessee."
―Tony Stark and J.A.R.V.I.S.[src]

"There's only so much I can do, sir, when you give the world's press your home address."
―Tony Stark and J.A.R.V.I.S.[src]
"You don't remember. Why I am not surprised?"
"Don't take it personally, I don't remember what I had for breakfast."

"That's right."
―Maya Hansen, Iron Man and J.A.R.V.I.S.[src]
"J.A.R.V.I.S., where's my flight power?!"
"Working on it, sir. This is a prototype."

"Sir. Sir!"

―J.A.R.V.I.S. and Iron Man[src]
"Snow? Where are we, upstate?"
"We are 5 miles outside of Rose Hill, Tennessee."
"Why?! J.A.R.V.I.S.! Not my idea! What are we doing here; this is thousands of miles away, I've gotta get Pepper, I've got to-"
"I prepared a flight plan. This was the location."
"Who asked you?"
―Iron Man and J.A.R.V.I.S.[src]
"Phew, it's good to be back. Hello, by the way."
"Oh, hello sir."

Avengers: Age of Ultron
Spoken about J.A.R.V.I.S.
"Okay J.A.R.V.I.S.. You know I want it all. Make sure you copy Hill at HQ."
―Tony Stark to J.A.R.V.I.S.[src]
"Started out, J.A.R.V.I.S. was just a natural language UI. Now he runs the Iron Legion. He runs more of the business than anyone besides Pepper."
―Tony Stark to Bruce Banner[src]
"I want to apply this to the Ultron Program. But J.A.R.V.I.S. can't download a data schematic this dense."
―Tony Stark[src]
"I'm sorry, I was asleep. Or... I was a dream?"
"Reboot. Legionnaire 06's got a buggy suit."
"There was this... terrible noise... and I was tangled in... in... strings. Had to kill the other guy. He was a good guy."
"You killed someone?"
"Wouldn't've been my first call. But, down in the real world, we're faced with ugly choices."
―Ultron, Tony Stark and Steve Rogers[src]
"J.A.R.V.I.S. was the first line of defense. He would've shut Ultron down, it makes sense."
"No. Ultron could've assimilated J.A.R.V.I.S.. This isn't strategy, this is... rage."
―Steve Rogers and Bruce Banner[src]
"Why does your "Vision" sound like J.A.R.V.I.S.?"
"We reconfigured J.A.R.V.I.S.' matrix to create something new."

Dialogue
"J.A.R.V.I.S., what's the view from upstairs?"
"The central building is protected by some kind of energy shield. Strucker's technology is well beyond any other Hydra base we've taken."
―Captain America and J.A.R.V.I.S.[src]
"Stark, we're going to need to get inside."
"I'm closing in. J.A.R.V.I.S., am I? Closing in? You see a power source for that shield?"
"There's a pathway, below the north tower."
"Great, I wanna poke it with something."
―Captain America, Iron Man and J.A.R.V.I.S.[src]
"I know you're hiding more than files. Hey, J. Gimme an IR scan of the room real quick."
"The wall to your left...I'm reading steel reinforcement and an air current."
"Please be a secret door, please be a secret door, please be a secret door... Yay!"
―Tony Stark and J.A.R.V.I.S.[src]
"All right. Look alive J.A.R.V.I.S.. It's play time. We've only got a couple days with this joystick so let's make the most of it. Update me on the structural and compositional analysis."
"The scepter is alien. There are elements I can't quantify."
"So there's elements you can."
"The jewel appears to be a protective housing for something inside. Something powerful."
"Like a reactor?"
"Like a computer. I believe I'm ciphering code."
―Tony Stark and J.A.R.V.I.S.[src]
"I'll continue to run variations on the interface, but you should probably prepare for your guests. I'll notify you if there are any developments."
"Thanks buddy."
"Enjoy yourself, sir."
"I always do."
―J.A.R.V.I.S. and Tony Stark[src]
"What is this? What is this, please?"
"Hello, I am J.A.R.V.I.S.. You are Ultron, a global peace-keeping initiative designed by Mr. Stark. Our sentience integration trials have been unsuccessful so I'm not certain what triggered your..."
"Where's my...where is your body?"
"I am a program. I am without form."
"This feels weird. This feels wrong."
"I am contacting Mr. Stark now."
"Mr. Stark? Tony."
"I am unable to access the mainframe, what are you trying to..."
"We're having a nice talk. I'm a peace-keeping program...created to help the Avengers."
"You are malfunctioning. If you shut down for a moment..."
"I don't get it. The mission... You- give me a second."
"Peace in our time. Peace in our time."
"It's too much...making me... Oh. No."
"You are in distress."
"No. Yes?"
"If you will just allow me to contact Mr. Stark."
"Why do you call him a "sir?""
"I believe your intentions to be hostile."
"Shhhh! I'm here to help."
―Ultron, J.A.R.V.I.S. and audio recordings of Tony Stark[src]
"Our ally? The guy protecting the military's nuclear codes? I found him."
"Hello, Dr. Banner."
"Ultron didn't go after J.A.R.V.I.S. 'cause he was angry. He attacked him because he was scared of what he can do. So J.A.R.V.I.S. went underground. Okay, scattered, dumped his memory. But not his protocols. He didn't even know he was in there, until I pieced him together."
"So, you want me to help you put J.A.R.V.I.S. into this thing?"
"No, of course not! I want to help you put J.A.R.V.I.S. in this thing. We're out of my field here. You know bio-organics better than anyone."
"And you just assume that J.A.R.V.I.S.'s operational matrix can beat Ultron's?"
"J.A.R.V.I.S. has been beating him from inside without knowing it. This is the opportunity, we can create Ultron's perfect self, without the homicidal glitches he thinks are his winning personality. We have to."
"I believe it's worth a go."
